~Notes: These zones are based off the names of the directories 
 in CVAT since I don't have the original data. If these don't 
 align with what you've collected beforehand, odds are what you 
 have before is more accurate.

~Notes: Bidar, the only district in NORTH EAST TRANSITION, 
 doesn't have any SkySat data, hence why that zone has zero TIFs. 
 Also, these are the stats *before* annotations since individual 
 .tiff files don't maintain the location data. I could probably 
 find exactly which .tiff files had annotations and match them 
 with their locations, but it would take a while so I didn't do 
 that for now.

~Notes: I filtered to only get the zones with the top 10 most area 
 in California (there are also zones 4b, 5a, 5b, 11a, 11b that I could 
 easily get if necessary), but some of the images I downloaded overlap 
 with neighboring zones, hence why zones 5b and 11a also have some data.
